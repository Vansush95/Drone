GUI LINUX VULNERABILITY SCANNER
Vulnerability scanner for Linux based OS , written in Python using GUI
This is a tool in python made to enter Commands CLI into a user friendly user interface.
It is still at its development state but I hope to use and expand this tool to the field of malware analysis to perform easy automation on checking binary files.
